        Cosmos Station is a simple, student-friendly portal to visualize and learn about our solar system.

          Our goal is to make space science accessible and engaging. Instead of
          just reading about planets, you can interact with them directly on
          screen—hover, click, and explore.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project is especially helpful for school and college students who
          want a quick, visual way to revise the basics of the solar system.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe learning becomes more memorable when it is interactive,
          visual, and fun. Cosmos Station is a small step in that direction.
